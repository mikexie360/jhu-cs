## Questions and Channels of Communication

Asking important questions is important during the requirements phase of the project.

Asking questions is important to illicit information.

Different stakeholders have different understanding of a requirement is.

More effective questions can mitigate this problem.

## Three channels of communications.

Verbal
- What you say
- What you write
Paraverble
 - How you say it.
Nonverbal
- Body Language

93 % of information that is sent is the paraverble and nonverbal channel.
55 % nonverbal channel
38 % in the paraverble
7 % in the verbal or written channel.

Look out when the 3 channels are not in sync with each other.
When the nonverbal or paraverble, the verbal is what people believe.

## Risk
Risk is associated with getting complete requirements information.

It is risky to only use one channel of communication, such as verbal.
