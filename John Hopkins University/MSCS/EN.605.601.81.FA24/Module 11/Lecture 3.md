Defect: Either a fault or discrepancy between code and documentation that results in mischief in the testing, installation, maintenance or use of software.

Errors cause Defects, which cause Failures

### Ways to find defects

Reviews
Walkthroughs
Formal Inspections
Testing
Bug reports


Finding Errors is called Root Cause Analysis
From why did the failure happen will lead to the defect.
Why did the defect happen will lead to the error

### Handling Defects

What to do once a defect is found
- Record and categorize the defect
- Identify and record the error
- Look for similar defects and errors
