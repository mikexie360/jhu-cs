## Code based test design

Also called white box testing.


White box testing should be done by the developers and not by independent testers.


- Statement coverage
- Branch coverage
- Decision / condition coverage.

### Statement coverage

Covering all statements in the code.

### Branch coverage

Covering all branches.
May need multiple test cases.

### Decision/Condition Coverage

Write enough tests for all branches and all combinations of getting the branch.
A lot more through.

### Basis Path testing
Utilizing the flowgraph for a method in conjunction with cyclomatic complexity metric to generate a set of test paths that yield a very high degree of code coverage.
