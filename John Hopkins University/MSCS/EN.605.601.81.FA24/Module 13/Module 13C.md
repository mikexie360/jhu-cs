## Testing Principles

Just because a program passed all the tests, doesn't mean there aren't any defects.

Dynamic Testing only shows the presence of defects, not the absent of defect.

Exhaustive Testing, do every possible input and every valid triplet.

How many execution paths?
Each test does one execution path.
But is still exhaustive.

There is a risk with dynamic testing. There are many tests you have to do with dynamic testing.

### Basic Testing Principles.

1. Test Planning should begin during the requirements phase.
2. Test plans should be driven by, and linked to, the format requirements.
3. Test case components must include, test inputs, expected results, evaluation criteria, assumptions/constraints.
4. Every test case should be as repeatable as possible.
5. Test case data and results should be documented and retained
6. All software changes should be regression tested prior to releasing a system to the production environment
7. Independent test teams should plan and perform system and acceptance level testing.
8. Testing cannot prove the absence of errors in a software product
9. Testing effectiveness can be improved by including people with business area expertise on the test team.
10. Testers should never assume that software is correct. Let the testing effort provide the evidence.
