In object-oriented testing the scope could be a class, a method, a group of classes, or the entire system.

### static and dynamic testing

Stating testing involves testing a software item without actually executing it on a computer

Dynamic testing involves testing a software item by executing the software item.

### Fault Directed and conformance directed tests

Fault directed tests are test that are designed to reveal faults in the software item under test.

Conformance directed tests are tests that are designed to demonstrate compliance of the software item under test with the requirements.

### A test case

### A test set
A test set is a collection of one or more test cases applied to the item under test.
Test sets are sometimes called test suites.

### Regression Testing
Regression testing involves repeating a subset of previously executed tests after a change has been made to the item under test.
