## Testing perspectives

Examples of test sets

1. Valid for each type
2. Invalid data input
3. Invalid triangles
4. Extreme point tests
5. Permutation Test

## Black box testing

Designing test cases based on the requirements for the item under the test.

The code for the item under test is not needed or needed in the design of the tests.

### Common Testing problems

- No systematic testing process
	- Repeatability, if I estimated again, I would come up with about the same amount of tests each time.
	- Defendability, Why I need these tests.
- Testing too late in life cycle
	- Testing too late will lead to rework.
- Poor requirements
	- May lead to rework
- Unclear responsibilities
	- Sometimes there will be over test or less testing
- Data First Test Cases
	- Design the test set, and then figure out the data
	- We shouldn't care about data values, until we figure out what kind of test sets we need and how many tests.

Over test, under test syndrome. Lots of useless tests
