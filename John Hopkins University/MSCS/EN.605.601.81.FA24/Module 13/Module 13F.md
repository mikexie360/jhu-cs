## Requirements Based Test Design

- Input Space partitioning
	- Used to partition the input side of the function to identify test conditions
	- Some age groups have same insurance rates, so we can partition those input spaces.
	- All of those equivalence classes should output the same thing to pass the test
- Boundary testing
	- Test the boundary of equivalence classes.
- Decision tables and trees
	- Turning business rules from a narrative format into a decision table.
	- Decision trees can also be used.
