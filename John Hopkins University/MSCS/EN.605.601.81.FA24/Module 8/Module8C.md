## Finding Candidate Classes

- Find classes of interest in problem domain
- Model Static Relationship
- Determine the responsibilities of the objects
- Model the dynamic behaviors

### What to look for
- Objects have state
	- Contains information hidden inside the object
	- Encapsulates, we hide the data, we don't care how it is stored.
- Objects should have high cohesion
	- All data and behavior is highly related to each other in the object.
- Objects should be loosely coupled
	- dependencies are well defined
	- minimize the number of dependencies
	- Decrease the complexity of the graph to a minimum

### Anthropomorphism
We treat objects like people.
People can store data, have behaviors, and send messages.
