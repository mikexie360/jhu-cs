## Object-Oriented Principles

Object-Oriented Principles
- Objects
- Messages
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Objects
- An object is a thing
- Thing can be tangible or something conceptual.
	- A plane or the event of a plane that is landing or takeoff
- Something in the problem to be solved
- A collection of data that describes something
- Two Main Properties
	- Data, state, attributes, fields, member data, and slots
	- Behavior, operations, methods, member functions, procedures and services
- Must invoke the objects member functions to get the data
	- Send a message to request a service
- Name, Parameter and result are called signature of the operation
- Set of operation signatures for an object is called its protocol

### Class
- A form of abstraction
- Treating a group of objects in the same way.
- A template for object instances
- A class can create objects
- A class is a type of object
	- It encapsulates data, like the data types an object accepts, methods, and operation signatures
	- It also has behavior, such as constructors.
- Classes and objects are stored differently
	- Classes are loaded into static memory
	- Objects are created dynamically.

### Inheritance
- Some groups of classes have generalizations and are similar to each other.
- A general class is usually the superclass.
- A specialist class is usually the subclass.
	- Can have their own method and signatures and override operations
	- Must use all methods and state from the super class.
	- Must override all abstract operations
### Polymorphism
- can convert objects up or down the inheritance and use methods from the superclass.
