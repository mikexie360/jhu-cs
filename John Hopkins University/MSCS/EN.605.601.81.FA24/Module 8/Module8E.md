## CRC Analysis

### CRC Card
An object can remember things and do things

- Knows things
- Can do something

Collaborator
- Another object that is needed to help perform a responsibility


Example:
Product
- Knows Price
- Can Compute Tax
- Is dependent on Tax

Works best when done face to face, synchronously.
