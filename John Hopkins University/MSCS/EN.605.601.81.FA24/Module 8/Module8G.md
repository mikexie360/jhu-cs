## Classes and Object Instances

UML Classes need
- Class name
- Data
- Functions

Object Instances
- Variable Name: ClassName
	- We don't always need a variable name, we can make anonymous object instance
- Data with values.


In the analysis model
- No link directionality is assumed
- Link is not stored in either object
- Links are not necessary conduits for messages
