### Software Quality Reviews

1. Identify Work Product Defects
2. Remove Work product defects as early as possible
3. Ensure the work product satisfies its requirements.

### Three Quality Review Models

1. Round Robin Review
	1. A quality review process in which a work product is distributed to reviewers, usually sequentially. The reviewers make comments and circulate the work product back to its author.
	3. There are several variations on this model.
	4. Cons
		1. Lack of consistency and rigor
		2. Give it a half hearted look.
		3. Lack of information transfer
		4. Not everyone is at the meeting together
		5. Project schedule is delayed if it takes too long.
		6. Author might not even look at the comments.
2. Informal Walkthrough
	1. A review process in which the author of a work product leads one or more members of the project team through the work product.
	2. While other members ask questions, make comments about the style, technique, possible errors, violations of the standards, discuss alternative approaches, and other issues.
	3. Solutions to issues may also be discussed.
	4. Review model is synchronous. Virtual or in person
3. Formal Inspection
	1. More structured
	2. A formal evaluation technique in which a software work product is examined in detail by a person or group other than the work product author.
	3. Purpose of the inspection is to identify defects, violations of standards, and other problems.
	4. Specific steps must be followed 
	5. Defect and effort data is collected.
	6. Invented to mitigate problems in software reviews.
