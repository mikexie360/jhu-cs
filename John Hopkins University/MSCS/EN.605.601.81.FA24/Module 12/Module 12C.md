## Defect Detection and Repair Cost Driver

- Detection point rework

- Error amplification

The number of defects might increase the number of defects exponentially, by one defect causing another defect.

- Size Complexity
Number of code, project size
How many people are in the project.

### Error amplification model

Some errors from current phase.
Some errors from prior phase

Some 50% errors will accumulate
Some 50% errors will amplify

Some Errors will remove, but some errors will move to the next phase.


##### Impact of Error Amplification

Defects Grow Geometrically.
