Software Engineering Introduction

# Overview

## Is Software Engineering a profession?

Nope, software engineering isn't really a profession.

# Software Engineering

## Definitions

### Software 
- is not Hardware
- Program, Instructions that direct computer hardware to perform a task
- procedures and documentation
- Data, input and output
- Types of software include applications (performs a task for an end user) and system (general purpose, tools, operating systems, compilers, text editors)

### Engineering
- Craft 
	- Produces real products for real people.
	- Artisans and craftspeople
	- No scientific background or formal training required
- Science
	- Discovery of facts and truth about the universe
	- Application of the scientific method
	- Based on scientific principles
	- Academic training necessary
- Engineering
	- Goal to produce real products for real people
	- Well defined and repeatable based on science
	- Academic training necessary.
#### Examples
| Craft                  | Science | Engineering |
|------------------------|---------|-------------|
| Plumber                | Fluid Dynamics  | Water resource engineer  |
| Carpenter              | Static physics  | Structural engineer      |
| Electronic Hobbyist    | Solid state physics | Computer chip designer  |
| Chemistry Hobbyist     | Organic Chemistry  | Chemical engineer     |

### Software Engineering
- Real products for real people
- Based on Scientific principles ( computer science )
- Requires academic background
- Repeatable, well defined procedures and processes.
