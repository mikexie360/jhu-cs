## Why Requirements are important

The Requirements phase in a project can be a major source of defects.

The requirements for a project are used as input to many of the project life cycle work processes.

Requirements defects contribute significantly to the cost of project rework.

60-67 % of defects were introduced during Requirements Phase.

Other project phases are dependent on requirements

Major Types of Requirements Defects

Incorrect Information: 49%
Omitted Requirements: 31%

Characteristics of good requirements
- Correct 
	- A Requirement should be correct
	- Key Project Stakeholders should be identified
- Complete
	- Micro level completeness is applied to each individual requirement
		- each individual requirement should have clearly defined functional requirements.
	- Macro Level completeness is applied to the entire set of requirements for the project.
		- Using an iterative lifecycle and use cases could help find functional requirements.
- Testable
	- Can we construct a set of tests, to test if it has been implemented
	- Can we test if has been implemented correctly and completely.
- Unambiguous
	- Effective documentation
	- Is testable
