## What is a Requirement

Things that are a minimum to turn in?

Organizations have had difficulty of getting good requirements.
Reason is because different stakeholders have different requirements.

Projects start off with unrealistic expectations. So we need to level the expectations.

Requirement is a capability that must be delivered by the system or a condition that the system must satisfy.

Capability = Functional Requirement
Condition = Non-Functional Requirement

Functional Requirement Example:
- Calculate Order Discount
Functional Requirements can have 5 moving parts
- Inputs
	- User input
- Constraints
	- Criteria that have to be met, in performing.
	- Performance constraint
	- Or comply with policy
- Intended Functionality / definition
	- Name of the requirement
- Business Rules
	- How to take the input and convert them into outputs.
- Outputs
	- Output to the user

Non-Functional Requirement Example:
- How many simultaneous users a system must support
- How much downtime is allowed
- What operating system the system is allowed to operate on.

Doesn't describe behavior but does describe conditions and constraints.
