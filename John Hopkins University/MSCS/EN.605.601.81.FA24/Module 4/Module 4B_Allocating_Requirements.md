## Allocating Requirements

It is necessary to identify the system components.

Some examples of system components might be
- Hardware
	- Sensors
	- Storage devices
	- Embedded application
- Software
	- Software components
	- Application software
	- Operating Systems
	- Databases
- People
	- People that interact with the systems
- Processes
	- Modifying processes

Once the Subsystems have been identified, system functions must be allocated to them.
This is is called functional allocation or functional analysis

Hardware components are perfect to have functional allocation when there needs to be constant monitoring or a high level or precision is required.

Software components are perfect when a human is interfacing with it or if it needs to be changed overtime.

Physical constraints need to be taken into account. Space, weight or temperature needs to be taken into consideration.
