## What is a System?

Dictionary Definition:
> A regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole.

INCOSE Definition:
> A homogeneous entity that exhibits pre-defined behavior and is composed of heterogeneous parts that do not individually exhibit that behavior... an integrated configuration of components and/or subsystems.

An Easy Definition from Systems Engineering Principles and Practices:
> A set of interrelated components working together toward some common objective.

### Systems Engineering

Wikipedia Definition:
> An interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems.

A. Kossiakoff Definition
> The function of systems engineering is to guide the engineering of complex systems.

Systems engineering, is reserved for complex systems.

Systems have components that work together. Called subsystems

A car is a system with well defined behavior:
A sub system in a car can have its own subsystems.

A car has a powertrain, information system, body control system. And each of those systems have their own components.

### Allocating Requirements

First two phases of the life cycle consist of system requirements analysis and system design. 

System requirements analysis determines the requirements for the overall system, called system level requirements.

Some will be done with software, and some will be done with hardware. Functional allocation will allocate the system functionality to the system hardware components and its software components. Then the engineering process will begin. At some point the software and hardware will be integrated.
