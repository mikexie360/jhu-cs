## Analysis and Design Principles

- Modularity
	- Making things more manageable
	- Breaking things into pieces
	- Decomposition
		- Breaking things into smaller parts
	- Composition
		- Combining modules into something bigger.
	- Benefits
		- Reduces complexity
		- Results in easier implementation
		- Facilitates change
		- Encourage parallel development
	- Cost of the system increases complexity and cost exponentially
	- Module
		- Component
		- Class
		- Method
		- Package
		- Subsystem
	- Connected by an interface
	- High Cohesion
		- How close a module itself works together
	- Low Coupling
		- Standardized interfaces
		- reduces overall complexity of the system
- Abstraction
	- Model the essential parts of something
- Encapsulation
	- Separation of information into specification and implementation
