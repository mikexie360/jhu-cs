## Behavior Modeling

Imperative Models
- How things happen
- Change over time
- Use Case Specification
	- Shows a flow of events
	- used for requirements specification

	- Shows a flow of events 
	- Has swim lanes for different domains
- Sequence Diagrams
	- Shows different sequences and messages sent between entities

Declarative Models
- What happens
- Does not show change over time.
- Pre/Post Conditions
	- What changes, but not how it changes.
- Decision Tables
- State Transition Diagrams
- Stepwise Refinement
	- Divide and conquer
	- Break into smaller problems
