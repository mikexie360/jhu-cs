## Levels of Development

- Problem Statement
	- What is the problem to be solved
	- Avoid "Jumping to solution"
	- Ask why? What is the problem you are trying to solve?
- Requirement Specification
	- How will we solve the problem?
	- The structure of the black box, and don't worry about what is inside it
- Analysis Model
	- Identify and specify the main data and functional components.
		- Noun-verb analysis
	- Static Models
		- Shows the structure of the solution
	- Dynamic Models
		- Shows what happens when the solution is working.
- Design Model
	- Analysis is a refinement of the requirements
	- Design is an abstraction of the code.
		- How the code works
