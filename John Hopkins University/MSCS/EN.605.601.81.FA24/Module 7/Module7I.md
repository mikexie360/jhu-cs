## Encapsulation

Each module has two views
- Specification: the "what"
- Implementation: the "how"


Client-Server Paradigm
- Client knows the server
- Server doesn't know the clients
- Client doesn't know how the server works
- Server doesn't know how the clients work.

Benefits of Encapsulation
- Client doesn't need to understand the complexity of the server's implementation
- The server can protect its internal state
- The implementation of the server may be modified without affecting the clients

Correctness
Does the implementation do what the specification says it will?
