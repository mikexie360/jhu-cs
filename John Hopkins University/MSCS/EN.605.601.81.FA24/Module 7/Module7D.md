## Structure Modeling

- Hierarchical
	- Graph with no cycles
	- Lattice Structure
	- Dependencies all flow in the same direction
- Layered
	- Base Layer - Do basic specific things.
		- OS, Languages
	- Common Services - Broad reuse potential
		- Message Queueing
		- Database accessing
	- Domain Specific - Implementing specific domains
		- Banking
		- Insurance
	- Application Layer - Represent the system that is built
		- A Complete Application
- Network
	- Can't be structured in layered and can have cycles
	- UML models, nodes and edges, activity diagrams
	- The internet is an example of a network.
