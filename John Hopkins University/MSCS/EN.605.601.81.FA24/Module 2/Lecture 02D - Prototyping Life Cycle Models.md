## Rapid Prototyping Model

Acts as a tool for the waterfall model

A rapid prototype is a model of a piece of a software product, that has limited functionality and can be produced quickly.
Expected to be produced within a few hours or a few days.

The prototype is a functional software with some user interfaces.
- Navigation
- UI
- Reports

Rapid prototype can be used at any phase.
- planning and definition
- Requirements
- Analysis
- Design
- Coding

Purpose is to provide working software of what the actual software will look like.
Prototype is used to show the user what the software will look like. Then the prototype is thrown away.

## Evolutionary Prototype Model

Starting with a general idea of the software. Then iteratively evolve the product.
Adding more and more features until it satisfies the customer.

Prototype is not thrown away, instead evolves into the final product.

Good, when the requirements are changing rapidly, when the customer or the developers does not know what the application area.

The disadvantage is that it is difficult to know how many iterations it will take to get the final product. And it requires good discipline by the developers so that we don't back into a code and fix model.

## Spiral Model

A hybrid of an iterative model and a prototyping model.

Risk driven.
Uses a prototype and iteration to calculate risks.

Each iteration is often managed as a separate mini-project.
each iteration identifies one or more major project risks.
and iterations continue until all the major risks have been addressed. Then the final iteration can employ the waterfall model.

Earlier iterations are cheaper than the next iteration.
Earlier iterations are simpler to implement and are considered a partial prototype.

Each iteration has a series of steps
- Determine objectives, alternatives, and constraints
- Identify and resolve risks
- Evaluate alternatives
- develop the project deliverables for that iteration and verify they are correct
- Plan the next iteration
- Commit to an approach for the next iteration.

Disadvantages:
- Very complicated
- Needs a lot of management attention
