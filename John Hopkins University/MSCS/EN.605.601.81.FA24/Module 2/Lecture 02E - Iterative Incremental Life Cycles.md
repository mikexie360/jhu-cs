# An Iterative/Incremental Life Cycle

iterative means that some life cycles are meant to be repeated multiple times. Such as Requirements, design, code and test. Incremental means, that each release of software contains additional functionality. Similar to the stage delivery life cycle model.

Each increment contains multiple iterations of a RDCT to be packaged for delivery.

## Unified Process Life Cycle Model

The Unified Process Life Cycle model allows for overlapping activity.

Some activities can be done at the same time, on some phases.

Iterative Incremental models have better adaptability to mid course corrections.
Good visibility and good predefined schedule constraints and also good if the requirements are not clear.
Very scalable. Good with small and large projects.

However, requires good management.
