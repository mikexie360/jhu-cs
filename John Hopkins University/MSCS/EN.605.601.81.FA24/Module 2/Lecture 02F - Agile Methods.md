# Agile Software Development Methods

SLC - Software Life Cycle

- Waterfall
- Iterative
- Spiral
- V-Model

The project transition to multiple phases. And can take years to complete a project to a rigid schedule.

## Agile Manifesto's 4 Values

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working Software over detailed documentation
3. Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

![[Agile Manifesto.png]]

Meet business objectives by following and responding to change.

| The standard SLC methods for 40 years                                         | Value delivery to customer occurs with each iteration (typically 1 - 4 weeks) |
| Value delivery to customer occurs at project completion. (months - years)     | Continuous feedback permits requirements to evolve                            |
| New requirements can't be considered without substantial inefficiency (waste) | "Lean" philosophy minimizes waste.                                            |

Agile is not only for software but also complex tasks.
Agile is good for self organizing teams.
Agile is inefficient when the requirements are static.

Agile Methods
- Crystal
- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming
- Dynamic Systems Development
- Feature Driven Development
- DevOps

Each method is distinguished by seeking to optimize specific characteristics and capabilities.

## Scrum

minimizes time to value delivery to the customer.

uses self organizing team of 5-9 people.

Product Owner
- represents the stakeholders and creates user stories
- receives the deliverables and asses the value.
- Adds stories to the back log
Team
Scrum Master
- facilitates the team and removes obstacles
Stake Holder

A sprint is typically 1-4 weeks.
Daily Scrum lasts about 15 minutes
Sprint planning is about 2 hours per week of the sprint.
Sprint review is 1 hour per week of the sprint.
Sprint retrospective is 45 minutes per week of the sprint.

Team member pick stories on the backlog and work on them.
At the end of each sprint new working code is delivered to the product owner.

# Agile Kanban

Seeks to achieve just in time delivery.
Suited for tasks of known duration.
Kanban is not timed boxed and there are no sprints.

Items start in the To-Do state, then team members move them to doing and then to done.

The amount of work in each column is limited in a work in process limit called WIP limits.
Each column may have its own WIP limits.

Scrum is useful for cross functional teams / teams with multiple capabilities.

Kanban uses a Kanban board, while Scrum shows tasks in the backlog and tasks being worked on in a given sprint.

Scrum tasks are time boxed, because sprints have a specific duration. Kanban limits the amount of simultaneous tasks.
Scrum can carucate the number of tasks attempted or completed per sprint. This is known as velocity. Velocity = number of tasks per sprint.
Kanban does not use Velocity, because there are no sprints.

## Requirements for successful agile efforts
Team members need to be familiar with agile to attempt it.
Learning Agile takes time and investment, and could also be a cultural challenge.
Not all projects need agile

## Best fit: agile or sequential?
Selection of SLC method depends on multiple factors
- Requirement maturity/stability
- Team member experience with the method considered
- Customer expectation and Buy-in
- There is no one-size-fits-all

## Impact of Project Characteristics on the Choice of Development Approach and Trends in Modern Project Delivery

![[ModernSoftwareDeliveryMethods_2023 1.pptx]]

Most common in the study was a hybrid approach of both waterfall and iterative and agile approach.

Agile was the second most common.

Companies with many employees, were the dominant group for traditional approaches.

Companies with low employee counts were the dominant group for iterative and agile approaches.

Organizations tend to use traditional approaches on high critical projects, followed by hybrid, iterative and agile approaches.

Projects with 1 team used agile and iterative approaches.
Projects with 2-3 teams were distributed fairly equally across all approaches.
Projects with 4  or more teams were using traditional and hybrid approaches.

## When Hybrid Approaches Work Best  
• Diverse stakeholder needs  
• Varied project phases  
• Uncertain requirements  
• Risk management  
• Complex project structures
