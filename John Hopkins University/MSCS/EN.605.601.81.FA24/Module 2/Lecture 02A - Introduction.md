# Software Process

A software process is a related set of activities that leads to the production of a software product

There are different kinds of software processes.

- Can be very linear
- Can be very iterative in nature
- Can be sequential and iterative

## Why use a software lifecycle model?

A lifecycle model provides a framework and foundation for the project.

The Framework includes
- Standards
- Visibility
	- Shows the visibility of the project to stakeholders
- Planning
- Control

## Impacts of choosing an appropriate life cycle model

Some use only one project life cycle mode, some use a combination.

Choosing the correct one can increase development speed, product quality, tracking and control and client relations, and reducing project risk and project overhead.

### Code and Fix Model

1. Start with a general idea of the product
2. Then the development team code it and fix it
3. Ship to the client

Pros, very simple, no documentation, no quality assurance, shows quick progress.

Very good for one time uses, and prototypes and throw always.

Doesn't yield many benefits.

Just because this model works once, doesn't mean it will work again.

### Types of Life Cycle Models

Can pick one or more with a combination
- Sequential
- Prototypes
- Staged Delivery
- Iterative Incremental Models
