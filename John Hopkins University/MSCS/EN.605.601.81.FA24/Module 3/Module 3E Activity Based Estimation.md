## Activity-Based Estimating

- Task Identification
	- Create a work breakdown structure.
		- Lists of all the work that will be performed on the project.
		- Each part of the project might have a different work breakdown structures and each group that collaborates on the project may have their own work break down structure.
		- Work breakdown structure is hierarchal.
		- First level has a component for each phase of the project life cycle
		- Second level breaks the work in each phase into major tasks.
		- Doesn't State the order, only that the task must be done.
		- Task refinement, breaking down a task into subtasks
		- Example tasks, Interviews, Analyze Existing Systems, Weekly progress meetings, and customer reviews, project rework
- Effort Estimation
	- Work breakdown structure can be updated in effort estimation
- Cost Estimation
	- Estimate project costs
	- Labor Costs (80% of the project costs)
- Task Sequencing
- Schedule Estimation
