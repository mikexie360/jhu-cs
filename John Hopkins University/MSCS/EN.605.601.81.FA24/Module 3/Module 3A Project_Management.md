# Project Management

Definition of a project

According to PMI, the Project Management Institute, a Project is a temporary endeavor that is undertaken to create a unique product or service.

From a software engineering perspective, a project would be an endeavor that results in a new software product, or new software product.

A project has a distinct beginning point and a distinct ending point. Some projects go on for years, with no distinct ending point.

Project with no distinct ending point, loses focus, in constant chaos and a lack of control.

Best practice, a project has a starting point and ending point.

## Project Management

Project Management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to protect activities in order to meet or exceed the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.

A project exists to create a product, to meet the needs of the stakeholders.
So, it is important that the needs of the stakeholders be clearly identified early on.

Stakeholders, anyone who is directly or indirectly impacted by the product or service that is created by the project. 

One problem is that software projects do not have all relevant stakeholders not identified and collaborated with. This leads to incorrect or incomplete product that negatively affects the customers organization and workflow.

## The Project Management Process

- Project Initiation.
	- To start the project and get the ball rolling
	- Feasibility studies
	- Concept definition
	- Problem definition
	- identifying key product features
	- stakeholders analysis
	- vision document and vision statement
		- overall problem
		- opportunity
		- project scope
		- key product features
		- key stakeholders and their needs
	- project charter
		- states that the project exists and defines the project scope
		- the project manager and other key organizational managers
		- decision making authorities and chain of command.
		- identify staff members, and roles and responsibilities.
- Project Planning
	- Planning out the project
- Project Execution
	- Execution of the project
	- Construction of the software product
- Tracking and Control
	- Monitor progress and make adjustments
	- Supposed to be ongoing,
	- New and changing requirements, will be needed
	- New staffing and hires, may mean adjustment to the project.
- Project Closure
	- The ending of the project
	- When the product is delivered.

## Umbrella Processes

Umbrella processes span the duration of the project.

- Quality Assurance
	- Testing
- Config Management
	- Management of configuration
- Requirements Management
	- Management of requirements

## When things go wrong

###  Throw more money to fix the problem

When an IT project is over budget or behind schedule, the most likely thing to happen by internal project managers would be to increase budget, add more staff. increase oversight, get outside help, suspend or postpone the project.

A misconception is that "at some point in time the project must have gone 'off track'", when in reality the project was doomed from the start with poor project planning.

When a project falls behind schedule, a common solution that managers do is throw more money at it. This indicates that the original budget or schedule was unreasonable in the first place, because of the poor planning.

But its just not only poor planning, but also poor understanding of project requirements and deliverables.
Failure to track project progress can also lead to failure.

Increasing budget does not fix any issues, as the underlying problem might be poor planning, poor tracking or poor understanding of the project.

### Adding more people to the project.

Barry Boehm (father of software engineering economics), "Adding more people to a late project will make it later". Not always true, but true often enough to pay attention to it.

Second most likely thing a project manager might do to a late project is to add more staff.

Adding people to a project might work for certain cases for certain projects, and may shorten the schedule.

Adding more painters to a house is an example of shortening the project schedule because they can work in parallel. However, this does not work for software projects. There are many dependencies that rely on each other and many software product components. It may be possible to divide up the software engineering work across multiple engineers, but only up to a point. It may be possible to break up testing activities across more staff, but only to a point. 

There are certain physics associated with software projects. Certain activities have to be done in a particular order. There is a limit to how many division of labor is possible. Adding more people to a project increases the cost, but not always shorten the project schedule. And it could actually increase the project schedule from management action.

Coordination and team size become more and more complex, more costly and more likelihood of increase miscommunication.

n is the number of project team members
(n(n-1))/2

project managers must keep everyone in sync with the projects current status. And the time it takes to do that increases nonlinearly as the team size increases.

If one person misinterprets a piece of key information, that can impact some or all of the project team.

As the team size grows, the project staff and the project manager will likely have to spend more time communicating then they did before to keep everyone in sync. This needs to be factored in to estimate the real impact of the project schedule.

When more people are added to a project, it results in multitasking. Staff are required to split time between tasks on multiple projects in order to help out on the project having trouble. Staff productivity decreases as the number of tasks someone is expected to handle increases beyond about two. This increases risk, project schedule, and decreases productivity.

### Increase project oversight

Increasing oversight means increasing the frequency of project status meetings.

If a project team was meeting on a weekly basis to discuss project status, a project manager may increase the status meetings to twice per week. It may seem logical that increasing the number of meetings will help out if applied to specific tasks that are in trouble. 
This could help but in reality is that increasing oversight 
- will always increase costs 
- and will usually increase schedule
This is because costs increased because additional effort required for the oversight meetings is generally not budgeted for.

Example, if we have four project team members, and an additional one hour oversight meeting is implemented each week. that's an additional four person hours of effort that generally hasn't been budgeted for. Over the course of a month, that's an additional two person days worth of costs.

Schedule will likely be increased because 4 person hours work per week for additional oversight meetings will take the project team away from doing actual project work they would have been doing were it not for the additional oversight meetings.
