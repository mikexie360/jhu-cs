## Schedule Estimation

Schedule Estimation involves combining task sequences, effort estimates, constraints, and resource assignments to estimate calendar completion dates.

Factors that increase schedule
- Effort
	- person days
- Resources
- Efficiency

Factors that decrease schedule
- Dependency
- Deadlines
- Interruptions

Effort is not the same as schedule
Effort cannot be mapped one to one to calendar time.

20 person day effort.
if some tasks can be broken up into parallel, then it can take 20 calendar days.
If some tasks cannot be broken up then it will take longer than 20 calendar days.

Project critical path is the longest path throughout the project network diagram.

It determines the project completion schedule. Extending the project critical path will extend the project schedule.

Tasks not on the critical path can have slippage.

Tasks on the critical path have 0 slack or 0 float.

A manager must monitor the critical path to make sure the project stays on schedule.

The critical path may change as the project progresses and there can be multiple critical paths in a project.
