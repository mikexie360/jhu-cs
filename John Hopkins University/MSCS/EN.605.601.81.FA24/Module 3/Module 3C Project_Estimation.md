## What gets estimated?

- Effort
	- How much time is needed to perform project tasks
	- Person hours, person days, person weeks, person months, person years.
	- Amount of work it takes to do something
	- Helps in estimating cost
	- Not related to calendar time
- Size
	- total number of lines of code
	- total number of function points
	- Can be used to estimate effort. Correlation between effort and size
- Cost
- Schedule
	- Related to calendar time duration
	- specific calendar dates

Size can help calculate effort, effort can calculate cost.

## Center for Project Management

42% use Guesstimates
	Guesses and conjecture verses some underlying methodology
34% use Dictimates
	Dictated values, like costs, or schedules are used.
24% Other

Dictimates are not even that much better to guesstimates

Estimating is challenging for software engineering. But there are are a few techniques that help with the estimation.

## Estimate

An estimate is an approximate judgment or calculation about something.

Estimates should not be presented as precise estimates or point estimates.

Estimates are made without complete or perfect information. Have some degree of uncertainty. 

There is no absolutely correct value for an estimate in an software engineering project. Staff productivity can vary significantly.

Two software engineers could have different productivity and end up with different cost and schedule.

## Accuracy and Precision

High accuracy - Close to the actual result.
High Precision - Consistent.

If we estimate 10 person days to complete a task. But it takes 12 person days instead. We are within 20% of the actual.

The precision is the range of the actual result to fall in. The higher the precision, the smaller the range.

The stated precision is a statement of what you expect to happen. But you don't really know the actual precision is until the actual result is known.

Precision is also a way to express the confidence or uncertainty that you have in your estimate.

As the known become knowns, you can have more precision and be more precise in your estimate.

As the project progresses, we can be more and more precise with our estimates.
