## Task Sequencing

Task Sequencing process involves identifying and documenting the sequencing and the dependencies between project tasks.

Some tasks can be done in parallel, meaning some tasks are not dependent on each other.

Some tasks must be done in sequence, meaning that those tasks are dependent on each other.

- Task Sequence and dependency identification
- Project Network Diagramming

Mandatory dependencies.
The tasks are dependent because of the nature of the task. Test plan must be developed before testing can occur.

Discretionary Dependencies.
Up to the project manager or whoever is planning the project. A large programming task can be broken into smaller subtasks. 

External Dependencies.
Activities that have to be completed but outside of the project manager. Example is that it is contracted out.

## Project network diagramming
Diagramming out the project dependencies.

### Activity-on-Node format

- Each node represents a work task
- Arrows show task dependencies
- Format commonly used by automated tools

### Activity-on-Arrow format

- Arrows represent work tasks
- Nodes show task dependencies
