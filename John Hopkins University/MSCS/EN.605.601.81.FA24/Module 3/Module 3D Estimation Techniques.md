## Estimation Techniques
- Expert Judgment
	- Relies on the experience of one or more individuals for the project at hand.
	- Works when there are actual experts and historical information, and structured process is used.
	- When it is documented and communicated to project stakeholders.
- Structured Group
	- Multiple estimators, who are typically experts form the estimating team, and they follow a structured process in arriving at their estimates.
	- Delphi method.
		- Developed by RAND corp, for projects that have never been used
		- Panel of experts, a coordinator and a set of use.
		- Coordinator provides background information,
		- Estimator comes up with an estimate anonymously. document their rationale
		- The cannot consult each other, but can with the coordinator.
		- They keep doing this until the estimates matches up, and a reasonable range can be formed by the coordinator.
		- Because of the process, the estimation is repeatable compared to other estimation techniques.

- Rule of Thumb
	- Making a size estimate, using total lines of code expected, and then calculating how many lines of code a programmer and do a week
	- Rule of thumb estimates do not scale between different project sizes.
- Algorithmic
	- Using calculations or formulas for estimating software product size and then provide an estimate of the effort cost or product schedule.
	- Historical data must be used to calibrate the models.
	- If historical data is not available. The resulting estimate may be 100 of magnitudes off.
	- Cheap and quick
	- Function Point Model
		- Measure the number of functionality a product needed needed
		- Developed by Allen Alberich at IBM
		- External Inputs, External Outputs, Internal Logical Files, External Inquiries and External Interfaces
	- COCOMO 2 Model
		- Application-Composition Model
			- Estimating prototyping projects
		- Early Design Model
			- Estimating projects once the requirements set is established
			- Effort Nominal is estimated in Months
			- Size is thousand lines of code.
			- B is based on some product characteristics
			- W is process attributes.
			- Effort Nominal = 2.94 * Size ^ B
			- B = 1.01 + .01* Sum(P1,P5)
			- Effort Adjusted = Effort Nominal * Product(W1, W7)
			- Duration = 3 * Effort Adjusted ^ (.33 + .2*(B-1.01)
		- Post-Architectural Model
			- Most detailed model and can be used when the design architecture is established.
		- Reuse Model
			- Used in projects that have reusable software components.
- Activity Based
	- Needs a work breakdown structure
	- Task Identification
		- List of all tasks,
	- Effort/Cost Estimation
		- Estimate the tasks in person hours
	- Task Sequencing
		- Find task dependencies to find the sequencing of tasks
	- Schedule Information
		- Task, dependencies and effort estimates, and staff resources to complete the project.
	- Shown to be the most accurate and required to be used in most contracts.
	- Disadvantages is that it can be time consuming, but projects can be broken down into sub projects.
