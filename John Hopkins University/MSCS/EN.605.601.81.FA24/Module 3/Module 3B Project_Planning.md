## Project plan must have the following

- What will be delivered
	- Specify what will be delivered
	- What will be produced over the course of the project.
- When the project will be delivered
	- When will major tasks and milestones be completed
		- A milestone is a reference point that marks a significant project event.
		- Milestone is used to measure project progress.
		- Milestone is not a work task, but is a set of work tasks
- How the project will be done
	- Specify the project life cycle
	- Have a list of work tasks to be done.
	- Sometimes called the work breakdown structure
	- How the project progress will be monitored and communicated
- Identifying project staff roles and responsibilities as well as customer and other stakeholder roles and responsibilities
	- This is accomplished by creating a work responsibility matrix.

Milestones by themselves don't need effort to do

A project plan will contain a list of milestones and a set date for every milestone to be achieved.

A project plan should be treated as a dynamic document and not as an one time document.
