## Project tracking and control

Process of tracking actual project progress against planned progress and it enables management to take corrective actions if necessary.

Provides visibility into the project progress to project stakeholders

Project data is periodically collected and analyzed.

Project Data could be things like time charts to the project by the project team.

If the project is progressing according to plan. Nothing needs to be done by the management.

If the project is not progressing according to plan, then corrective action needs to be taken. Adding staff, estimating costs, schedules and executing's change control mechanisms, or mitigating any risks.

## Measuring Project Status

- Earned Value Tracking
	- Earned Value Credit is only given if the entire task is completed, or a mile associated with it is completed.
	- Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) is defined as the monetary value of the work scheduled to be accomplished in a given period of time.
	- Actual Cost of Work performed (ACWP) is the cost actually incurred in performing the work in the scheduled period of time
	- Budgeted Cost of work performed (BCWP) is the monetary value of the work actually accomplished in the scheduled period of time. it is also called the earned value.
- Cost and Schedule Variance
	- deviations between planned performance and actual progress expressed in monetary units
	- Cost Variance (CV) = BCWP - ACWP
	- Positive value is ahead of plan
	- 0 value is on plan
	- Negative value is behind schedule
	- Schedule Variance (SV) = BCWP - BCWS
- Cost and Schedule Index

Cost performance index is the ratio of earned value to the actual cost of work performed
CPI = BCWP/ACWP

Schedule performance index 
SPI = BCWP/BCWS

Values greater than 1, means ahead of schedule
0 means on schedule
negative values means behind schedule
