## Benefits of Reuse

### Reliability
Measured in mean time to failure

- Greater care in building
- Multiple reuse

If we know that software will be reused, we take care of it and results in higher quality software.

We can test in parallel on different test cases.

The longer we test it, the more reliable it is

### Less Expensive.

Cheaper to reuse software or hardware.

### Capture Expert Knowledge

If we reuse software, we can use experts to write the components and frameworks.

### Standardization

If we reuse the same software, there would be a standard developed.

### Less Development Time

Less schedule risk.
