## Impediments to Reuse

### Software foundry.
Harden the software.
Make software more general

But not everyone is capable of hardening software.

### Who pays for this?

People don't have much incentive to make this happen.

### Not in Here.

Code that I write myself will be better than code that someone else wrote. That is a common belief.

### Legal issues

Intellectual property rights.

One organization writes reusable software.
Another organization reuses but fails and costs them money and other issues.
This is why we have license agreements.

### Trust

How do we know that there are no bugs or viruses?

Third party consumer reports help tell us if the software is good or not.
They test products in their own laboratories.

User feedback. We can ask the current users about the software.
