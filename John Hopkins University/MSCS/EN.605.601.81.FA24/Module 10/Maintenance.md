## Software Maintenance

Software doesn't wear out, but we still maintain them.

### Challenge to Maintenance

New hires work with maintenance to learn the software.

People that don't learn new software maintain the software.

Maintenance is always dealing with other peoples code


We don't have access to the source code.
No one knows the code anymore
No one uses the program language anymore
On machines that are obsolete.
No documentation
Poor structure to the code.


Quality of software vs Maintenance

Good quality software, usually receives maintenance, because mor people use it.

### Corrective Maintenance 
Fixing bugs. 20%
Adaptive, keeping up with new technologies. Application isn't changing, just extending its life. 25%
Perfective, make it work better or add new features. Customer are demanding more 55%

We maintain software because customers want more.


### Cost of Maintenance

For each dollar we spend on software, 1.5 - 4 dollars is spent on maintenance.
This is really expensive

So we need to reduce the cost of maintenance.
