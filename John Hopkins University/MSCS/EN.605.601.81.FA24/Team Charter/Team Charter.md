## 1. Team Information

### 1.1 Team Name

Our team will operate under the name **Team Among Us**, drawing inspiration from the popular social deduction game, _Among Us_. This choice reflects not only our appreciation for the engaging and strategic dynamics found in _Among Us_ but also underscores the relevance to our project. We aim to develop a game similar to the classic board game _Clue_, incorporating elements of mystery and strategy that are hallmarks of _Among Us_. This name symbolizes our commitment to creativity to a new board game called "Clue-Less".
