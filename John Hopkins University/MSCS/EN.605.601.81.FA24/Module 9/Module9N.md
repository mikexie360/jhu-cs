## Structuring Sequence Diagram

Use heading to have frames for a sequence diagram

- sd for sequence diagram

- ref to show a reference to another frame.

- loop to show a looping frame, based on predicate.

- alt for alternative behavior, with multiple predicates.
	You can use else, for alternative predicates.

- par, to show parallelism.

You can nest multiple sequence diagram together.

Frames must be fully contained in another frame.
