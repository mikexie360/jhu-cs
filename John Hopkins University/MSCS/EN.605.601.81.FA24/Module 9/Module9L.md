## Dynamic Design

### Invoking the System Operation

### Boundary Class
Boundary Class is a class on the server that a different system will call

Example is a REST API that accepts a GET request from a customer. That class that handles the GET request is the boundary class.

### Controller Class


### Obtaining an Object Reference
Store object information as an attribute
Ask another object for the reference
Use a singleton for global visibility.
