## Dynamic Analysis Modeling

### System Operations

Model a system operations.
A use case is a collection of system operations.

A system operation is a unit that cannot be decomposed any further.

System operation resolves a change in state of a system.

Systems State, two ways to store information. Attribute values, and links to connect objects between them.

Dynamic Analysis needs to show the before and after for the models.

We need to model how the system gets from the before state to the after state.
