## Usability Analysis

Usability Analysis Techniques

### Interviewing

Gain an understanding of the problem from the perspective of the interviewee.
Interview the users, they are the most important.
We need to interview enough of them to better understand the users needs.

Danger, it might be biased and the user might not think outside of the box.

Need to choose the right interviewer, and to be able to understand the answers and can ask follow up questions. Or know too much can bias the results.

A really inexperienced interviewer will have a list of questions to ask and won't deviate from that list, regardless from what the person is talking.

The interviewer should do most of the talking.

An introductory question is asked then the other questions is based on what the interviewer said.

### Brainstorming

Useful when know no one has much of an idea of how it should work.

More useful than people working by themselves.

Phase 1, pose a problem. each member offers solutions to the problem.
Phase 2. Ideas are categorized and some ideas will be bad, some ideas will be good.

### Field Studies

Good when we are replacing an existing system.

First send out analysts of how things are currently done. The analysts will document the business process, then they start working on a model and then start automating that process.

Need to be careful as replacing one system with another may upset users.

### Scenarios
 
Model how users will interact with the system.
