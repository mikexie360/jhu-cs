## Prototype

Concrete but partial implementation of a design.

Its basic purpose is to reduce risk in software development.

The risk of developing the wrong thing, or the risk of the user not knowing what they want.

Prototypes expose misunderstandings. 
User misunderstandings
- User or the customer don't know what they want.

Developer misunderstandings
- Developers are just guessing.

Benefits
- expose system capabilities
- expose confusing services
- provide early availability
- support user training
- support system testing

Low Fidelity Prototypes
- paper prototypes
- they can be shown ways the user can interact with the system.
- Quick and easy to create or modify.
- Their roughness helps to control premature commitment.
- Only sketches
- Example would be a storyboard for movies

High Fidelity Prototypes
- Mock ups of the actual user interface
- All of the buttons and menus work, but outputs are simulated
- Used with rapid prototype tools.
- Can be used to test the psychological usability principles
- High fidelity can impress managers  and clients who are not deeply involved in the requirements process.
	- They give the illusion that something's being accomplished.
- Customers can confuse the executable prototype with the main system.


Screen flows and layouts

Nodes represents the screens
Arrows represents the effective navigational actions such as button or menu selections.
Shows all possible flows from screen to screen.

Other Prototype Techniques
- System mockups
	- Fabricated Devices with simulated controls
- Wizard of Oz
	- Human behind the scenes simulated system actions
- Video Prototype
	- Great for selling
- Computer animation
	- Automatic Simulation
