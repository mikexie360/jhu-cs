## Initial Spark

What initially sparked your interest in technology? Do you have an early memory from childhood or did it come later?

My initial spark for technology most likely came from gaming and the internet. Almost every kid I knew during elementary school had some fascination with video games. I was extremely fascinated with video games. I became more and more active in gaming in my youth. Most of the games I played were MMOs, RTS, FPS and trading card games. This lead to me in high school to learn computer science, which lead to my interest in computer science and technology in general.
### Life Changing Moment

Can you describe an event, moment, or decision from which your life (career) took a new direction? From that day nothing was the same?

I don't believe there is a singular event, moment or decision that shapes or defines someone. Usually a person changes slowly after multiple events that happens in their life. 
But I do believe it is Generative AI on the internet.
Generative AI on the internet is potentially one of the biggest weapon a nation state could use and deploy during peace time.

It was a few months ago, I was on my phone laying in bed at 2 AM in the morning watching random YouTube shorts before going to bed. Now, most of these Youtube shorts were AI generated by bots, but I didn't mind because they had humor in it, even if the humor was random. 
But I see a guy named Destiny Live streaming at 2 AM in the morning in my time zone. Usually this streamer doesn't live stream at this time. But I decided to check out his stream before going to bed.
During that stream he was showing these twitter accounts talking to each other, but they don't seem right. They don't seem real. 
- One had a profile picture that seemed AI generated. 
- One twitter account had a African American profile picture, but in one of his tweets he shows his white foot in frame of a picture, and the picture was stolen from an old reddit post. 
- Another account posted nothing but the same AI generated image as if it was on a loop.
- Another had an african american profile picture, but seemed to support white supremacy, with images that looked like it was manipulated on twitter.
- Another outed itself and got prompt injected, but another was also prompt injected and actually made coherent targeted jokes, even with a prompt injection.
- Another had a profile picture that was faked, but it was a mug shot of a completely different person.
And all of these accounts were acting like real humans, but only talked with other accounts that looked fake.
The theory was, in the chat, that the reason why these fake twitter bot accounts were created and only talk to each other was to create fake engagement and to not be detected as fake.

During this stream the rabbit hole went deeper.

Destiny opened up a video of a guy named Egon Chalokian. As Destiny and the chat were doing research on this guy, They found out about his website that was on the topic of climate change. Most of the pictures of this guy was faked and photoshopped. The website that showed his address was not a real address. And it was likely that this guy was using fake images on his website for some unknown purposes.

The whole stream made it seem like nothing on the internet was real. Bots talking to each other for engagement, and maybe for some other purposes. Some guy creating a website and then faking a bunch of images for some purpose. The stream actually opened up my eyes and made me very much realize that a huge chunk of the internet is faked.

By 5 AM I was still up watching the stream, and couldn't stop. I did more research and found out that the FBI already created a report about this. On the released FBI report,, they worked with other intelligence agencies from other countries, and found out about a Russian state-sponsored software that were creating these massive botnets to influence foreign activity. These software that created these massive botnets were really sophisticated and acted like a propaganda weapon. This software called meliorator. As I read through the report, I became more and more impressed at what the russians were doing. The report stated that the bots were created to have a faked biography, faked personality and a faked soul. These bots could talk to each other, liking content and would try and talk to celebrities and replying to popular posts. They would spread misinformation and could be activated for some campaign.

Me learning all of this within a few weeks, is what kind of changed my life. Before this, I didn't really think about the negative consequences of AI and technology. Usually with a weapon you have to declare war, and most people agree that war is bad so it is very unlikely to happen here. But a botnet from a foreign country or organization that uses AI to influence the internet is way more dangerous. It affects more people and could be deployed at any time and is in use right now.

### Worst Day/Best Day

Have you faced a setback in your career that ultimately proved beneficial? At the time, it may have felt like the worst day imaginable, but looking back, it turned out to be a fantastic blessing. Could you share that story?

When I graduated was looking for a job, I spent a long while to look for a job. All of those rejections that I had in other companies proved to have worked out just fine. When I was looking for work, after a few rejections, it became really monotonous and predictable that I wasn't going to be picked.

But the company that did select me gives me a lot of freedom in what I do, which is invaluable. The company and school that I go to now has really good work life balance, compared to other companies.

### How did you end up at your current company?

What happened? By chance? Or did you have a strong drive for that company?

Got in by pure chance. 

Got into The Net VR because they needed me to build their development team with a the correct culture for growth.

Got into SUNY because they needed people with understanding of web services.

It starts getting easier to get a job when the company needs your skillsets.

## Passion Project

### What is the project you are most passionate about at the moment?

I'm still working on this, but it is an email validation service.

email validation services are already out there, but we want to try and create an email validation service that is faster than the competition with multiple worker nodes. 

It takes a few hours to validate a list of emails, but in theory it should take a few minutes if you split up the data and then process them and then combine them together.

### If you choose to talk about a product:

- Could you explain it to a 10-year-old?
	- The best way to explain it would be that instead of one guy doing all the work, we have a bunch of smaller guys doing parts of the work, which would be faster.
- Which business critical process does your product/feature help optimizes?
	- This would help with businesses that collect emails for outreach.
	- Business have people sign up with their emails for some service, but the emails that people put in might be incorrect or their servers went down, or that email address doesn't exist anymore. So we need to validate them before sending, or we lose reputation and be flagged.
- What is now possible that wasn’t possible before?
	- The cloud has made it easier to rent servers for this.
	- We want it to be able to be scaled up and scaled down depending on the demand.
	- Before, you had to have a set number of servers and it was harder to scale up or to scale down.

## Hackathons

Most of my experience with Hackathons have been with schools sponsoring a hackathon.
I have won two hackathons with my team so far. But also lost a bunch.

I really like the hackathons that are sponsored by a school. They have a bunch of different companies, a bunch of different challenges and activities. And in theory are pretty easy to win.

I really like hackathons, but don't do as much of them as of right now. But if I had to do a hackathon, I would do it for learning purposes of a specific technology, or if one of my communities that I was apart of was doing one, or if I was close to the general area that was doing a hackathon.

I will say that hackathons are great for learning, competing, networking and team building but not really great for making good code. Most hackathon projects that are submitted have really bad code, not scalable and was done in a few hours. And the hackathons that win are usually using a bunch of rest apis, microservices that they don't need, a bunch of different tech stacks and technologies, and a really pretty UI. Usually the software skills you use to win a hackathon won't translate well into building a long lasting product.
